Apparently, this is the first website I made which will contain something that can be loosely defined as content, and with that rises the question of how manage it all.
Should be easy enough, right? Since it is a static site just put all of your assets into the public folder and serve. Well yes, it can be that simple, but it is not a very elegant solution. Why? The content is bound to the 'form', aka the website. Anytime I would want to share new content, I would have to commit the changes directly to the same repo where the code is hosted.

## Enter CMS?

Unsurprisingly I'm not the first person to encouter this kind of problem. After a bit of research I found the solution I'm looking for is a content management system, a headless one to be precise. Let's copy paste the first google search definition.

> A headless CMS is any type of back-end content management system where the content repository “body” is separated or decoupled from the presentation layer "head."

There seems to be numerous different providers, I looked into three of them - ButterCMS, Sanity and Strapi. Now this article is not supposed to be a review so I will just briefly say that for one reason or another I found these solutions to be unsuitable for my use case. Brilliant, I'm right back at the beggining.
